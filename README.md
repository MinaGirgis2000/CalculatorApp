Calculator App

- This is just a Calculator that is similar to the standard Windows Calculator.

- It doesn't work as an actual app yet, but it works on an IDE if you have one.

- It also works when using the keyboard if you would rather type than using your cursor.

- The language used is Java. The reason for this is that I'm currently just trying to upgrade my programming skills.
