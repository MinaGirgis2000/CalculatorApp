Calculator App

- This is just a Calculator that is similar to the standard Windows Calculator.

- It doesn't work as an actual app yet, but it works on an IDE if you have one.

- It also works when using the keyboard if you would rather type than using your cursor.

- The language used is Java. The reason for this is that I'm currently just trying to upgrade my programming skills.

Controls:
Each number key will correspond with it's number (Obviously)
+ : Shift =
- : - (minus key)
ร : Shift 8 (*)
รท : / (forword slash key)
= : = or ENTER
Clear all : Esc

If you have any suggestions for any new controls or any other additions to the app it would be much appreciated.
