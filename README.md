CalculatorApp
This is just a Calculator that is similar to what the standard Windows Calculator.

It doesn't work as an actual app yet, but it does work if you have it work on an IDE.
The language used is Java. The reason for this is that I'm currently just trying to upgrade my programming skills, so that I can learn more in less time.
