Calculator App

- This is just a Calculator that is similar to the standard Windows Calculator.

- It also works when using the keyboard if you would rather type than using your cursor.

- The language used is Java. The reason for this is that I'm currently just trying to upgrade my programming skills.

- A huge thanks to my friend Rahul Chandra for helping on making this into an actually app, you can check him out here, https://github.com/xXTeraXx

Controls:
- Each number key will correspond with it's number (Obviously)
- add(+) : Shift =
- subtract(-) : - (minus key)
- multiply(ร) : Shift 8 (*)
- Divide(รท) : / (forword slash key)
- Equal(=) : = or ENTER
- Clear all : Esc

If you have any suggestions for any new controls or any other additions to the app it would be much appreciated.
