Calculator App

- This is just a Calculator that is similar to the standard Windows Calculator.

- It doesn't work as an actual app yet, but it works on an IDE if you have one.

- It also works when using the keyboard if you would rather type than using your cursor.

- The language used is Java. The reason for this is that I'm currently just trying to upgrade my programming skills.


If anyone wants to help, it would be very much appreciated if you help me on finding out a way to stop the calculator from inputting 8 whenever the user clicks Shift 8 which is '*' or 5 whenever Shift 5 is clicked which is '%'. I'm not sure on how to fix the problem and I've been spending hours trying to fix, so any suggestions would be very much appreciated. If possible I would like to keep everything Java for now since that is the only language that I currently know. Thanks.
